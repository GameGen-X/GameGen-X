## Datadaset Construction Pipeline
### Data Collection and Filtering
- **Sources**: Content was gathered from internet gameplay videos, focusing on gameplay footage with minimal UI elements.
- **Manual Filtering**: Low-quality videos were manually filtered out, ensuring the integrity of metadata such as game name, genre, and player perspective.

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Scene Segmentation**: Videos were segmented into 16-second clips using PyScene and TransNetV2, discarding clips shorter than 4 seconds.
- **Aesthetic Scoring**: Clips were scored using CLIP-AVA for aesthetic quality.
- **Motion Filtering**: UniMatch was used to filter clips based on motion.
- **Content Similarity**: VideoCLIP was employed to ensure content diversity.
- **Camera Motion Annotation**: CoTrackerV2 annotated clips with camera motion information.

## Dataset Overview
### OGameData
The `OGameData` dataset consists of 1,000,000 video samples curated from online gaming content. Each data sample includes metadata on video paths, text descriptions, captions, timestamps, and source URLs. Three smaller datasets, containing 10K, 50K, and 100K samples respectively, are available for quick testing and experimentation.

### File Descriptions
- **`OGameData.csv`**: The full dataset, under review and coming soon.
- **`OGameData_100K.csv`**: A subset of `OGameData` containing 100,000 generation training samples.
- **`OGameData_50K.csv`**: A smaller subset containing 50,000 generation training samples.
- **`OGameData_10K.csv`**: A compact subset of 10,000 generation training samples, ideal for initial experimentation.

### Data Fields
Each `.csv` file contains the following columns:
- **filename**: The video filename, derived from the original video ID and corresponding splitting ID, with a format such as `VIDEOID_scene-SPLITINGID.mp4`.
- **text**: Descriptive text accompanying each video clip with structural annotations.
- **short_caption**: A brief caption summarizing each video clip.
- **start_time**: The start time of the video segment in seconds.
- **end_time**: The end time of the video segment in seconds.
- **URL**: The source URL for each video, linking to the original content.

### Example Data Entry
| Text | Short Caption | Start Time | End Time | URL | Filename |
|------|---------------|------------|----------|-----|----------|
| "Player achieves a new high score by defeating a boss" | "Player defeats boss" | 00:02:15 | 00:02:30 | `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video1` | `video1.mp4` |
